# Position and Velocity Control of a 6 DOF AUV
 This repo describes our development in the process of using the best suited control algorithm aimed to be the framework on which an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle's motion works. This project is being pursued as an effort in reaching our aspiration as a part of BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus ; to participate in the Singapore Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Challenge- SAUVC.
Please refer to my [project page](https://amoghjuloori.github.io/projects/2022-12-15-Position-and-Velocity-Control-of-a-6-DOF-AUV) for a detailed report on the project.
